# Guqin Etiquette

## Place the Guqin
The guqin, being a multi-stringed instrument, is not as compact as the three-stringed pipa and cannot be comfortably held and played in one's arms. Instead, it must be placed on a table or desk to be played easily. Therefore, there are certain methods of placement.

The head of the qin is on the right side, and the tail is on the left. The "fu zhang" and "zhen" are inserted into holes on the desk, while the "yan zu" is placed on the surface of the desk. This is the placement method used with specially made qin desks. When using a regular table, the "fu zhang" and "zhen" should hang down from the side of the table, leaving a space of about three to four fingers' width from the table, making it easier to rotate the "zhen." 

The body of the qin should lean against the edge of the table, not placed in the center, closer to the player's body, making it easier to reach the strings. 

At both the neck and the "yan zu," a "qin jian" cushion should be placed to keep it stable. This prevents it from moving when pressing or plucking the strings. 

The "qin jian" cushion can be made of silk or cloth, about five to six inches long and about two inches wide, filled with coarse sand to the appropriate thickness, with tight seams to prevent sand leakage. This is also an essential piece of equipment.

## Sitting Posture

The seating should be slightly higher than commonly used chairs or stools, while the qin desk should be slightly lower than commonly used tables. The angle of the chair and desk should be such that the chest is about half a foot away from the desk after sitting down, with the heart aligned with the fifth and sixth huizhi of the qin. If leaning too much to the right, it may be difficult to reach the lower huizhi with the left hand, especially those beyond the fifth. Similarly, leaning too much to the left may weaken the strength when pressing on the second or third huizhi. Therefore, sitting with the heart aligned with the fifth and sixth huizhi is the most suitable, allowing for convenient fingering and plucking with both hands.

As for the posture of the whole body,  
The head should be upright, not drooping.  
The neck should be straight, not tilted.  
The shoulders should be level, not shrugged.   
The back should be straight, not hunched.   
Both elbows and wrists are pivotal for fingering and plucking movements. The elbows should be relaxed, and the wrists should be suspended, not clenched or resting on the qin surface.   
Both knees and feet are the support points for the whole body. The knees should be slightly apart, and the feet should be angled outward, not touching each other, particularly avoiding tilting or swaying.

All these aspects should feel natural and not rigid like a puppet. Otherwise, not only will it look awkward, but also the finger movements may be hindered. 

It's essential to maintain a balance between being mindful of the posture and not being overly constrained by rigid rules, allowing for a natural and harmonious playing style.

## Requirments for playing
During performance, not only the physical movements of the facial features and limbs have certain standards, but also the mind, thoughts, and breath should not be scattered and wild in order to achieve a profound state. Especially for beginners, it's crucial to establish a solid foundation and practice diligently to avoid forming bad habits that are difficult to change over time. The ancients had numerous rules and regulations in this regard. Here are the most important ones to consider, and learners must introspect and correct themselves regularly to naturally adhere to them.

Keep the mind tranquil and the body upright, avoiding restlessness and slouching.  
Maintain focused thoughts and concentrated emotions, avoiding disorderliness and distraction.  
Breathe evenly and concentrate the senses, avoiding roughness and indulgence.  
Finger movements should be simple and quiet, avoiding agitation. The use of both nails and flesh is necessary; excessive nails lead to a harsh tone, while excessive flesh leads to a muddy tone. By combining both, the sound will naturally be clear and sharp.  
Apply force with both hands subtly, avoiding excessive tension. Lightness should not be floating, and heaviness should not be coarse.  
When the thumb presses the strings, it should not be clasped by the index finger or exert excessive force, and the hand should not open too wide.  
When the index finger presses the strings, the fingertip should protrude outward, not sink inward; sinking inward is called "bent finger," which hinders proper pressing. Also, the middle finger should not press on it with excessive force.  
When the middle finger plucks the strings, although the thumb can provide support, it should not be squeezed too tightly to impede movement.  
The positioning of the fingers of both hands should be elegant and graceful. The fingers of the left hand should not stick together and lie flat on the strings, nor should the fingers of the right hand clench into a fist or lean against the yueshan. Although the little fingers of both hands are not actively used, the waist should remain straight without bending.  
Maintain a serious demeanor, avoiding excessive tension, bulging eyes, and open mouth. While movements should be lively, they should not descend into affectation or excessive flourish.
