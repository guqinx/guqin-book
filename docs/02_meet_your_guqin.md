# Meet your Guqin

Guqin, with the top made of paulownia wood and the bottom of catalpa wood, is constructed by combining the two woods together.

In the "Discussion on Qin Materials" from the "Ancient Sounds from Antiquity," it is stated: "The material of paulownia, with its empty core and sparse grains, is light when lifted, loose when struck, fragile when bent, and smooth when touched, embodying the four virtues of lightness, looseness, fragility, and smoothness." Therefore, using it for the soundboard can produce wonderful sounds. Catalpa wood, on the other hand, has a solid core and firm grains.

In the "Collected Works of Dongtian Qinglu," it is mentioned: "The sound is taken from the surface, but the richness of the sound is from the bottom; if the bottom wood is not firm, the sound will inevitably scatter." Therefore, it is used for the bottom plate, capable of consolidating beautiful sounds. Other embedded parts, such as "Yueshan," "Long Yin," "Jiao Wei," "Feng Zhen," and "Yan Zu," are made of rosewood, jade, rhinoceros horn, or ivory. The entire exterior is coated with primer and decorated with varnish. Passed down through generations, there are various styles, with the most commonly used being the "Confucius style."

The outward curvature, with inner depressions resembling overlapping tiles, is the surface, or the top.

The outward flatness, with slight depressions inside resembling tiles facing upward, is the bottom, or the lower part. (The bottom plate can also be flat both inside and outside.)

The hollow part where the two halves join is the belly, or the middle. (That is, the resonance chamber.)

One end is low and wide, forming the head, or the front.

The other end is high and narrow, forming the tail, or the back.

The two sides are sloped and straight, forming the left and right, or the outer and inner.   

# The Surface of Guqin

The very front end of the qin surface is called the "Phoenix Forehead."

Slightly higher up, about one or two fen (a Chinese unit of measurement), there is the "Chenglu," so named because of the small circular eyes on top resembling dewdrops, also known as "Chenglu," as it looks like the road under the city wall. Positioned under the "Yueshan," it is also called the "Yue Skirt." There are seven small circular holes on top, called "Xianyan."

Connecting to the "Chenglu" and rising another four or five fen is called the "Yueshan," also known as the "Linyue," because it stands tall and majestic, resembling the shape of a mountain.

Eight or nine fen inside the "Yueshan" is called the "Qixiang," slightly gathering in the middle to form the "Fengjing."

From the "Fengjing" gradually sloping downwards to the "Linyue" is called the "Flowing Water Place," also known as the "Yueliu."

The widest part below the "Fengjing" is called the "Shoulder," also known as the "Ancient Shoulder" or "Immortal Shoulder," named for its flatness resembling human shoulders.

From the "Shoulder" to the "Waist," it widens in the front and narrows in the back, resembling spread wings, called the "Phoenix Wings."

The "Waist" further gathers, called the "Dragon Waist," named for its curvature like a dragon, also called the "Jade Maiden Waist," for its slimness. At the end of the waist, it widens slightly to form the "Qiwai."

Beside the drawn shape of the tail is the "Crown Horn," named for its shape resembling a crown.

Because Cai Yong used paulownia wood for making the qin, there are traces of burning on the tail, also called the "Burnt Tail."

Slightly raised at the very end of the center of the qin surface is the "Dragon Lip," also called the "Dragon Lip."

Two lines inside the crown wrap around from the "Dragon Lip," called the "Dragon Whiskers," also known as the "Crown Lines."

Thirteen circular dots on the left side of the qin surface, resembling bright stars, are called the "Huizhi," also known as the "Radiance." They are numbered from near the "Yueshan" as the first huizhi, to near the tail as the thirteenth huizhi.


# The Bottom of Guqin
The style of the qin bottom is identical to that of the qin surface, resembling tiles facing upward. The very front end of the bottom is called the "Phoenix Gullet," directly facing the place under the "Phoenix Forehead" on the qin surface.

Next, the depression inside the boundary of the "Chenglu" and "Linyue" on the qin surface is called the "Zhen Pool," also known as the "Zhen Cavity" or "Zhen Cup," or the "Zhen Groove," which accommodates the "zhen."

Inside the "Zhen Pool," there are seven evenly spaced holes called "Zhen Eyes," directly connected to the "Xianyan" on the "Chenglu" above.

Seven small circular zhen are vertically arranged, called the "Phoenix Zhen." Below each zhen hangs a string, called the "Velvet Button."

In the center below the "Shoulder" is the qin chest, called the "Phoenix Breast."

There is a rectangular hole (sometimes circular) called the "Dragon Pool," located at the boundary of the fourth and seventh huizhi.

Near the edge of the "Waist," there are two small square holes, called the "Foot Holes."

Two feet are attached above, called the "Goose Feet," also known as the "Phoenix Feet," located at the boundary of the ninth and tenth huizhi.

In the middle of the bottom, just before the tail, there is a rectangular hole (sometimes square) called the "Phoenix Marsh," slightly shorter than the "Dragon Pool," located at the boundary of the tenth and thirteenth huizhi. (All pools and marshes are collectively called "Yue.")

In the center of the bottom, a pattern is drawn, resembling the "Dragon Lip" on the qin surface, but sloping downward, called the "Gum Support," also known as the "Lower Gum."

On both sides of the tail, hard wood is inlaid, called the "Burnt Tail Underlay."

This is a rough description of the parts of the qin bottom, illustrated in the accompanying diagram below.


# The Frontside of Guqin
At the edge of the qin head, it curves slightly, resembling an overturned boat. In the center, there is a crescent-shaped hole, called the "Tongue Hole." The protrusion inside the hole is called the "Dragon Tongue," also known as the "Phoenix Tongue."

On both sides, there are two hanging feet, called the "Duck Feet," also known as the "Zhen Guards."

At the rear edge of the tail, it rises up and slopes down, with a concave groove in the center, wider at the top and narrower at the bottom, serving as the string holder, called the "Mountain Mouth," also known as the "Dragon Mouth."

These are the general features of the front and back parts of the qin, as illustrated in the accompanying diagram below.

# The Backside of Guqin
The seven holes on the qin belly's "Yue Outer Margin" are the same as the "String Eyes." About eight or nine fen inside the "Yue," solid wood is left, called the "Neck Solid."

Behind the "Neck Solid" is a semi-circular pool called the "Sound Pool," which is deeper than the "Groove Belly."

Behind the pool is the "Qikong," also known as the "Groove Belly." Boundaries are left on both sides.

Right at the two places on the qin bottom where the pools are slightly raised compared to the groove belly are called the "Resonance Inlets."

Solid wood is also left where the phoenix feet are placed, forming a semi-circular shape outside and a square hole inside, called the "Foot Pool," also known as the "Phoenix Leg."

At the very end of the tail, another pool is created in the middle of the solid wood, called the "Rhyme Marsh," which is deeper than the groove belly.

The solid wood on both sides is called the "Tail Solid."

A cylindrical pillar is set in the center under the "Shoulder," supporting the bottom surface, called the "Heaven Pillar." Below the waist is the "Earth Pillar."

The "Heaven Pillar" is located between the third and fourth huizhi, one inch and two fen above the "Dragon Pool."

The "Earth Pillar" is located between the seventh and eighth huizhi, one inch and five fen below the "Dragon Pool."

These are the main features of the qin belly, as illustrated in the accompanying diagram below.

# The Size of Guqin
The length of the qin bottom varies in historical records. "Records of the Grand Historian" states: "The qin is eight chi and one cun long." "Customs and Traditions" states: "The qin is four chi and five cun long." However, "Records of the World" claims, "The qin made by Fuxi is three chi, six cun, and six fen long." Although there are differences in the length of the ancient and modern chi, they are generally consistent with the most ancient existing qin, the "Crane Cries in Autumn Moon" qin made by Lei Wei in the Tang Dynasty. Additionally, the qin making described in the Song Dynasty's "Essential Records of the Qin Garden" and "Knowledge of the Qin Garden" is based on the model of the qin made by Tang Dynasty craftsmen Lei Wei and Zhang Yue, with a length of three chi, six cun. Therefore, the measurements recorded in these texts are considered more reliable.

Based on the dimensions recorded by various sources and compared with the Tang Dynasty qin still in existence, here are the measurements:

"Essential Records of the Qin Garden": The qin body is three chi and six cun long.

"Biluozi" and "Ancient Sounds from Antiquity": The qin is three chi, six cun, and six fen long (consistent with the existing Tang Dynasty qin).

From the forehead to the yue is two cun (one chi and eight fen in the existing Tang Dynasty qin).

The yue is three fen thick and four fen high (consistent with the existing Tang Dynasty qin, which is five fen thick and high).

From the head to the shoulder is one chi (existing Tang Dynasty qin is eight fen and seven fen).

From the center of the qin body from the linyue to the long lip is three chi, four cun, three fen (existing Tang Dynasty qin is three chi, four cun, and four fen).

On both sides from the yue to the crown angle is three chi and three cun (Tang Dynasty qin is three chi, four cun, and five fen).

The forehead is five cun and two fen wide (Tang Dynasty qin is five cun and eight fen).

The tongue hole is six fen wide and two chi and six fen long, and one chi and two fen deep, with the wood inside (Tang Dynasty qin is the same width, three chi, two fen long).

The chenglu is five cun and one fen wide (Tang Dynasty qin is six cun and five fen).

The string eyes are three chi and seven fen apart (Tang Dynasty qin is three chi and eight fen).

The space behind the yue and entering the neck is five cun wide (Tang Dynasty qin is five cun and five fen). Compared to the forehead, it is two fen narrower.

The neck is four cun wide in the middle (Tang Dynasty qin is four cun and eight fen).

The flow from the center of the neck to the linyue gradually decreases by three and a half fen (consistent with the Tang Dynasty qin).

The shoulder is six cun wide (Tang Dynasty qin is seven cun).

From the center of the linyue to the top, the waist is two chi and two fen long, half a fen below the eighth huizhi (Tang Dynasty qin is two chi and three cun long, with the upper waist six cun wide).

From the upper waist to the lower waist is six cun and two fen, half a fen above the twelfth huizhi (Tang Dynasty qin is one chi, one cun, and four fen from the upper waist to the crown angle).

The middle of the waist is four cun and one fen wide (Tang Dynasty qin is five cun).

The tail is four cun wide (Tang Dynasty qin is four cun and four fen).

The long lip is nine fen long (Tang Dynasty qin is one chi and two fen).

The long lip is three fen wide (consistent with the Tang Dynasty qin).

The central bottom thickness at the front end of the tongue is one chi and two fen (Tang Dynasty qin is one chi, one fen, and five millimeters).

The two sides of the tongue continuously protect the zhen, with a total height of two chi and four fen (Tang Dynasty qin is one chi).

Each side of the chenglu is nine fen thick (Tang Dynasty qin is six fen).

Behind the yue, each side is one chi and one fen thick (Tang Dynasty qin is nine fen and a half on both sides at the yue, seven fen behind the third huizhi on both sides, and five fen on the inside).

Each side of the shoulder is seven fen thick (Tang Dynasty qin is one chi and one fen at the intersection of the shoulder and neck, one chi and five fen at the shoulder edge).

Each side of the middle huizhi is six fen and a half thick (Tang Dynasty qin is seven fen on the outside and six fen and a half on the inside).

Each side of the tenth huizhi is six fen thick (Tang Dynasty qin is the same).

The bottom surface at the very end of the tail is one chi and two fen thick (Tang Dynasty qin is one chi and one fen).

The zhen pool is four cun wide and seven fen thick (Tang Dynasty qin is four cun and a half long, with the same width).

The dragon pool is seven cun long, one chi and two fen wide, with the sticker inside (Tang Dynasty qin is six cun and seven fen long, nine fen and a half wide). It is located between the seventh and ninth huizhi (Tang Dynasty qin is raised from the fourth huizhi).

The phoenix marsh is three cun and seven fen long, one chi and two fen wide, with the sticker inside (Tang Dynasty qin is the same length, nine fen and a half wide). It starts between the tenth and eleventh huizhi (Tang Dynasty qin starts four fen below the tenth huizhi).

The belly is seven fen deep (Tang Dynasty qin is eight fen and a half deep from the center of the dragon pool).

The tail control is six fen deep (Tang Dynasty qin is seven fen deep from the center of the phoenix marsh).

The Tang Dynasty qin made by Lei Wei, "Crane Cries in Autumn Moon," is used as the benchmark for these measurements. It is one of the best-sounding qins among the surviving Tang Dynasty qins. These precise measurements are recorded in detail to serve as a standard for selecting qins. The actual measurements are based on traditional methods, cross-referencing qin scores to ensure practicality and reliability.
